Dear Developers,

We have implemented an OTP verification form with basic functionality, including input handling, OTP generation, copy to clipboard, visibility toggle, and resend timer. We are seeking your expertise to expand and enhance this code. Potential improvements could include better error handling, improved accessibility features, additional security measures, and user experience optimizations. Your contributions will help us deliver a more robust and user-friendly verification process.

Thank you for your assistance!
